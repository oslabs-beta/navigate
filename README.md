A visual overview of your Kubernetes cluster - with network policies, scheduler decisions, and live logs.
</p>

## Visualize your cluster before it starts running
Whether the cluster is live or not, upload your YAML config files to **Navigate**. Here you can see the network structure of your cluster, observing
the connections between your stateful sets, deployments, services, and other Kubernetes objects. <br/><br/>

<br/><br/> You can double check for mistakes!<br/><br/>
Click on the deployment nodes in your graph to zoom into the Node View, seeing the various containers and connections each deployment brings.

## Visualize all your network policies
Want to check that your network policies are correct? Use the "Network Policies" tab to view them all, one at a time.

## Get aggregated Live Logs

While the cluster is live, see: 
  -  etcd/node scheduler decisions, aggregated across many different logs
  -  live deployment data, including statuses and conditions
  -  live pod data that you would normally only get with `kubectl` commands
